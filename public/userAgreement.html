  <div class="text no-counter">
    <p>
      The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos,
      videos, audio, streams, or other materials (“<strong>Content</strong>”),
      including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or

      responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support,

      Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and
      authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within
      these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may
      expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all
      necessary rights.<br /><br />You retain any ownership rights you have in
      Your Content, but you grant Kleppit the following license to use that
      Content:<br /><br />When Your Content is created with or submitted to the
      Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,
      non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy,
      modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform,
      and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness
      provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels
      now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes

      that Kleppit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without
      compensation or obligation to you.<br /><br />Although we have no
      obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole
      discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason,
      including for violating these Terms, violating our
      <a href="https://www.kleppitinc.com/policies/content-policy"

    >6. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions</strong
  >

  <div class="text no-counter">
    <p>
      The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or
      services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our
      partners, or other users (“<strong>Third-Party Content</strong>”).
      Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible
      for any third party’s websites, products, or services. Your use of
      Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any
      investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in
      connection with such Third-Party Content.<br /><br />The Services may also
      contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree,
      and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge
      and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display
      of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.<br /><br />If
      you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest
      or sweepstakes (“<strong>Promotion</strong>”), you alone are responsible
      for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and
      regulations, including but not limited to creating official rules, offer
      terms, eligibility requirements, and compliance with applicable laws,
      rules, and regulations which govern the Promotion (such as licenses,
      registrations, bonds, and regulatory approval). Your Promotion must state
      that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with
      Kleppit, and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or
      participant to release Kleppit from any liability related to the Promotion.
      You acknowledge and agree that we will not assist you in any way with your
      promotion, and you agree to conduct your Promotion at your own risk.<br />

  <strong class="h4">8. Moderators</strong>

  <div class="text no-counter">
    <p>
      Moderating a subkleppit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be
      available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions
      taken by the moderators. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s
      ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including
      for a breach of these Terms.<br /><br />If you choose to moderate a
      subkleppit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You agree to follow the
        <a href="https://www.kleppitinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct"
          >Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities</a
        >;
      </li>
      <li>
        You agree that when you receive reports related to a subkleppit you
        moderate, you will take appropriate action, which may include removing
        content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to Kleppit for
        review;
      </li>
      <li>
        You are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on
        behalf of Kleppit;
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of
        Kleppit, or any subkleppits that you moderate, without our written
        approval;
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of
        compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from third parties;
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a
        subkleppit, you will use such information only in connection with your
        performance as a moderator; and
      </li>
      <li>
        You may create and enforce rules for the subkleppits you moderate,
        provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, the
        <a href="https://www.kleppitinc.com/policies/content-policy"
          >Content Policy</a
        >, or the

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Kleppit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action
      or decision of a moderator if Kleppit, in its sole discretion, believes
      that such action or decision is not in the interest of Kleppit or the
      Kleppit community.

      Your Content, but you grant Kleppit the following license to use that
      Content:<br /><br />When Your Content is created with or submitted to the

      However, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at
      any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms,

      There are no fees for the use of many aspects of the Services. However,
      some services, including Kleppit Premium, and Virtual Goods, may be
      available for purchase (“<strong>Paid Services</strong>”). In addition to
      these Terms, by purchasing or using Kleppit Premium or our Virtual Goods,

      Paid Services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material
      changes; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for
      temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees
      associated with the Paid Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
      price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier
      than 30 days following notice to you.<br /><br />You may submit your debit
      card, credit card, or other payment information (“<strong
        >Payment Information</strong
      >”) via our Services to purchase the Paid Services. We use third-party

      Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you
      give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that
      includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees.

  <div class="text no-counter">
    <p>
      Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify,
      and hold Kleppit, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
      employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, third-party service providers,
      and licensors (the “<strong>Kleppit Entities</strong>”) harmless from and
      against any claim or demand made by any third party, and any related
      liability, damage, loss, and expense (including costs and attorneys’ fees)
      due to, arising out of, or in connection with: (a) your use of the
      Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of
      applicable laws or regulations, or (d) Your Content. We reserve the right

  <strong class="h4">13. Limitation of Liability</strong>

  <div class="text no-counter">
    <p>
      By using the Services you agree that the Kleppit Entities’ liability is
      limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.
      Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach
      of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract.
      Kleppit isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of
      any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not
      apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for
      death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct,
      or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically
      promised to you.

      chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing you with
      notice through our Services at least 30 days before the date they become
      effective. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the
      Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised

      You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting
      your Account and discontinuing use of all Services. If you stop using the
      Services without deactivating your Account, your Account may be
      deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.<br /><br />To the fullest extent
      permitted by applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your Account,
      moderator status, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for
      any or no reason, including for violating these Terms or our

      and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these
      Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your
      access to and use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
      right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such
      right or provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or
      unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest
      extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and
      effect. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under
      these Terms without Kleppit’s prior written consent. Kleppit may, without
      restriction, assign any of our rights and obligations under these Terms,
      at its sole discretion, with 30 days’ prior notice. Your right to
      terminate these Terms at any time pursuant to Section 16 remains
